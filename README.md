## Introduction

Molecular dynamics simulations often involve complex lipid systems, such as DOPC lipids. Backmapping is a technique that converts an atomistic representation of a lipid to a coarse-grained representation. In this project, we employ a CNN-based AI model implemented in TensorFlow and Python to perform backmapping on DOPC lipids. This can lead to more efficient simulations and analyses while retaining crucial structural information.

## Features

- **CNN Architecture**: We leverage a Convolutional Neural Network architecture to learn the mapping from atomistic to coarse-grained representation.
- **TensorFlow**: The project is built using the TensorFlow framework, ensuring scalability and efficient computation.
- **Python**: All code is written in Python, making it accessible and easily modifiable.
- **Easy Integration**: The developed model can be seamlessly integrated into existing molecular dynamics workflows.
- **Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation is provided to help users understand and use the backmapping tool effectively.

## Installation

To install the backmapping tool, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone
cd backmapping
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
