#   - `raw/` - raw data, will not be altered
#   - `membranes/` - each membrane has its own folder containing an at.pdb and cg.pdb representation file
#   - `molecules/` -  each molecule has its own folder (membrane_index_molecule_index) containing an at.pdb and cg.pdb representation file
#   - `figures`/ - figures generated by the analysis scripts
#   - `resuluts/` - results generated by the analysis scripts
#   - `topologies/` - topologies used for the simulations
