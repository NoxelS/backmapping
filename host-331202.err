Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-da75_zaf because the default path (/home/users/noel/.cache/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/users/noel/projects/backmapping/src/master.py", line 135, in <module>
    master_socket.bind(server_address)
OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use
